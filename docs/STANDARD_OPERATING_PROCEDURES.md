## AI-Assisted Website Development

If you need to recreate or make significant updates to the website using an AI assistant like Lovable, use these structured prompts as starting points:

### Core Website Structure Prompts

1. **Initial Setup and Branding**:
   ```
   Create a modern, responsive website for an emotional fitness coaching business. Use a dark theme with accent colors (brand-blue, brand-purple, brand-pink). The site should convey premium coaching services for high performers with a focus on emotional optimization and peak performance.
   ```

2. **Page Structure and Navigation**:
   ```
   Build a website with the following pages: Home, About, Services, Testimonials, Pricing, FAQ, Contact, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Legal Disclaimers. Create a responsive navigation header and footer with social media links to Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
   ```

3. **Hero Section Development**:
   ```
   Design a compelling hero section with a gradient background, bold headline "GET AFTER IT, FAMILY!™", and subheading "Optimize your emotions for peak performance." Include a prominent call-to-action button linking to the booking system.
   ```

### Functionality Prompts

4. **Booking Integration**:
   ```
   Integrate Calendly for session booking with the URL https://calendly.com/alan-muellegger/emotional-fitness-session. Create a dedicated Contact section with the booking calendar embedded and a contact form.
